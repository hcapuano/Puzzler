# Puzzler
HTML/CSS/JS Puzzler project

This is actually my first web projet from my first year of study at Supinfo.  
I had 1 week to do a puzzler game with HTML/CSS and Javascript.  
I remember, this is absolutly not responsive, no bootstrap like, no framework... it's kind of old fashioned... :smirk:  

Here is the game page, sorry for that :sweat_smile:
